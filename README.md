The WiFi IR Blaster is designed to connect all of your old, legacy IR-controlled devices to a WiFi network -- exposing them to a new method of control. Want to control your TV via a web-browser? Want to ask Alexa to mute your stereo? Want to schedule triggers to your IR-controlled LED strip? These are all applications that the WiFi IR Blaster is perfect for.

The WiFi IR Blaster combines an ESP8266 -- a powerful WiFi/microcontroller SoC -- with an IR emitter and receiver. With built-in WiFi support, the ESP8266 can be programmed to provide an interface between HTTP, MQTT, TCP, and UDP services and infrared-controlled devices.

This product includes the WiFi IR Blaster, a [Lite-ON LTE-302](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LTE-302.pdf) infrared emitter, and a [TSOP38238 IR receiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266). The IR emitter and detector are not populated on the board -- allowing you to assemble them in any orientation your project requires.

For help getting started, check out our [WiFi IR Blaster Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/wifi-ir-blaster-hookup-guide), which explains how to assemble the board, program it, and use the [IRremoteESP8266](https://github.com/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266) Arduino library.
